# Feature Lock & Scope Definition

Finalize what's in and out of the MVP.

## üéØ Mission: Draw the Line - Ship or Skip

### Scope Decisions
- **core**: Lock essential features only
- **extended**: Include nice-to-haves
- **minimal**: Absolute minimum viable

## Task: Define and Lock MVP Scope

### Step 0: Read Project Context
**Load existing specifications to understand project state:**

1. **Find the active project**:
   - List all directories in `.kiro/specs/`
   - If only one project exists: Use that project
   - If multiple projects exist:
     - List all project names with their descriptions (from 01-init.md)
     - If $2 != "-y": Prompt user to select project
     - If $2 == "-y": Use the most recently modified project
   - If no projects exist: ERROR - Must run `/kiro-rapid:01-init` first

2. **Read previous phase documentation**:
   - Read `.kiro/specs/[project-name]/01-init.md` - Project info
   - Read `.kiro/specs/[project-name]/02-demo.md` - All implemented features
   - Read `.kiro/specs/[project-name]/04-feedback.md` - Stakeholder feedback (if exists)
   - Read `.kiro/specs/[project-name]/05-iterate.md` - Iterations done (if exists)
   - Extract complete feature inventory and current status

3. **Build context summary** for scope definition

### 1. Feature Inventory

Catalog everything built so far:

```markdown
# Current Feature Inventory

## ‚úÖ Implemented & Working
- [FEATURE_1]: Basic functionality complete
- [FEATURE_2]: Demo-ready with mock data
- [FEATURE_3]: UI complete, backend partial
- [FEATURE_4]: Added during iteration

## üöß Partially Complete
- [FEATURE_5]: Frontend done, no backend
- [FEATURE_6]: API exists, no UI
- [FEATURE_7]: Works but buggy

## üìã Requested but Not Started
- [FEATURE_8]: High demand, complex
- [FEATURE_9]: Nice to have
- [FEATURE_10]: Enterprise only
```

### 2. Decision Matrix

Create `mvp-scope.md`:

```markdown
# MVP Scope Decision

## üéØ Core Features (MUST HAVE)
> These define our product

| Feature | Status | Effort to Complete | Decision |
|---------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| User Dashboard | 90% done | 2 hours | ‚úÖ INCLUDE |
| Basic CRUD | Working | 0 hours | ‚úÖ INCLUDE |
| Data Export | 70% done | 3 hours | ‚úÖ INCLUDE |

## üåü Stretch Features (NICE TO HAVE)
> Include if time permits

| Feature | Status | Effort to Complete | Decision |
|---------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Advanced Filters | 30% done | 8 hours | ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFER |
| Mobile View | Not started | 12 hours | ‚ùå EXCLUDE |
| API Integration | Planned | 16 hours | ‚ùå EXCLUDE |

## üö´ Out of Scope (NOT NOW)
> Explicitly excluded from MVP

- Multi-tenant support
- Advanced analytics
- Custom workflows
- Enterprise SSO
- Audit logging
- Internationalization
```

### 3. Technical Debt Assessment

What debt is acceptable for MVP:

```markdown
# Acceptable Technical Debt for MVP

## ‚úÖ Debt We'll Keep
- Hardcoded configuration values
- No input validation
- Minimal error handling
- No automated tests
- Code duplication
- Inline styles
- Mock data for some features

## ‚ùå Debt We Must Fix
- Security vulnerabilities (if any)
- Data loss bugs
- Complete feature failures
- Infinite loops or crashes

## üìÖ Post-MVP Debt
- Proper authentication
- Database optimization
- Code refactoring
- Test coverage
- Documentation
```

### 4. Feature Freeze Declaration

```javascript
// feature-freeze.js
const MVP_SCOPE = {
  version: "1.0.0-mvp",
  frozenDate: new Date().toISOString(),

  features: {
    included: [
      "User Dashboard",
      "Basic CRUD Operations",
      "Data Export (CSV only)",
      "Simple Search",
      "Basic Reports"
    ],

    excluded: [
      "Advanced Filters",
      "Mobile Apps",
      "API Integrations",
      "Custom Themes",
      "Multi-language"
    ],

    maxChangesAllowed: 0 // No more features!
  },

  qualityBar: {
    mustWork: [
      "Core user flow",
      "Data persistence",
      "Export functionality"
    ],

    canFail: [
      "Edge cases",
      "Concurrent users",
      "Large datasets",
      "Browser compatibility (IE)"
    ]
  }
};

// Lock it
Object.freeze(MVP_SCOPE);
localStorage.setItem('mvp-scope', JSON.stringify(MVP_SCOPE));
```

### 5. Stakeholder Communication

Generate `scope-announcement.md`:

```markdown

  },

  limits: {
    MAX_USERS: 100,
    MAX_RECORDS: 1000,
    MAX_EXPORT_ROWS: 500,
    SESSION_TIMEOUT: 3600000 // 1 hour
