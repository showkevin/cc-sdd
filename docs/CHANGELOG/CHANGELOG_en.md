---

## Ver 0.3.0 (August 12, 2025 Update)

### Major Kiro Spec-Driven Development Command Improvements

**Workflow Efficiency**
- Added `-y` flag: `/kiro:spec-design feature-name -y` skips requirements approval and generates design
- `/kiro:spec-tasks feature-name -y` skips requirements+design approval and generates tasks  
- Added argument-hint: Commands now auto-display `<feature-name> [-y]` during input
- Traditional step-by-step approval still available (spec.json editing or interactive approval)

**Command Optimization**
- spec-init.md: 162→104 lines (36% reduction, removed project_description and simplified templates)
- spec-requirements.md: 177→124 lines (30% reduction, simplified verbose explanations)
- spec-tasks.md: 295→198 lines (33% reduction, eliminated "Phase X:", functional naming, granularity optimization)

**Task Structure Optimization**
- Section headers for functional area organization
- Task granularity limits (3-5 sub-items, 1-2 hour completion)
- Standardized _Requirements: X.X, Y.Y_ format

**Custom Steering Support**
- All spec commands now utilize project-specific context
- Flexible Always/Conditional/Manual mode configuration loading

## Ver 0.2.1 (July 27, 2025 Update)

### CLAUDE.md Performance Optimization

**System Prompt Optimization**
- Reduced CLAUDE.md files from 150 lines to 66 lines
- Removed duplicate sections and redundant explanations
- Implemented unified optimization across Japanese, English, and Traditional Chinese versions

**Functionality Preservation**
- Maintained all essential execution context
- Preserved steering configuration and workflow information
- No impact on interactive approval functionality

**Minor Updates**
- Added "think" keyword to spec-requirements.md

---

## Ver 0.2.0 (July 26, 2025 Update)

### Interactive Approval System

**Approval Flow Improvements**
- `/spec-design [feature-name]` now displays "Have you reviewed requirements.md? [y/N]" confirmation prompt
- `/spec-tasks [feature-name]` now displays review confirmation for both requirements and design
- 'y' approval automatically updates spec.json and proceeds to next phase
- 'N' selection stops execution and prompts for review

**Simplified Operations**
- Previous: Manual editing of spec.json file required to set `"approved": true`
- Current: Simple response to confirmation prompt completes approval
- Manual approval method remains available

### Specification Generation Quality Improvements

**Enhanced requirements.md Generation**
- EARS format output now generates in more unified format
- Hierarchical requirement structure outputs in more organized format
- Improved comprehensiveness and specificity of acceptance criteria

**Enhanced design.md**
- Technical research process now integrated into design phase
- Requirements mapping and traceability reflected in design documents
- Improved document structure for architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, ERDs
- More detailed descriptions of security, performance, and testing strategies

**Improved tasks.md**
- Implementation tasks optimized for code generation LLMs
- Test-driven development approach integrated into each task
- Clearer management of inter-task dependencies
- Improved to independent prompt format aligned with Kiro design principles

### Fixed Issues

**Improved Directory Handling**

- More user-friendly error messages

**Improved Internal File Management**
- Excluded development prompt files from version control

### System Design Simplification
